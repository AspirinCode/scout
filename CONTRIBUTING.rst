Development
-----------
Vagrant is used to create a separate and reproducible development environment.

CSS
~~~
The preprocessor for CSS used is SCSS and compiled using the node-sass/libsass compiler. Browser support is limited and developers are encouraged to use flexbox instead of relying on something like Bootstrap.

Tips
~~~~
Whenever in doubt, use whatever convention GitHub is using. No more JS than that, be strict about the REST interface conventions:

  /<username>/<repo>/issues/new
