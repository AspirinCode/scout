   \n        \n    \n    Analyze VCFs and collaborate on solving rare diseases quicker\n\n\nWhat is Scout?\n\nSimple - Analyze variants in a simple to use web interface.\nAggregation - Combine results from multiple analyses and VCFs into a centralized database.\nCollaboration - Write comments and share cases between users and institutes.\n\n\n\nNew entry in the blog: What's new in 3.5?\n"},"install.html":{"url":"install.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Install Scout\nThis guide will walk you through how to setup a working instance of scout.\nThe instructions are divided into multiple sections.\nOne section describes how to set up a demo version with some cases just to see how it could look like.\n0. Intro\nMake sure you have a mongod process running. First install mongodb and follow the instructions.\n1. Install\nInstallation of Scout is possible via pip or GitHub.\nLet's start by pulling down the GitHub repository with the source code.\nGitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout\ncd scout\npip install --requirement requirements.txt --editable .\n\nPip\nTo get the latest version, use the above. When using pip the latest stable release will be installed.\npip install scout-browser\n\n \"Credentials\". Here you will\nfind your \"CLIENT ID\" and \"CLIENT SECRET\". You also need to add some\n\"REDIRECT URLS\" and \"JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS\".\n\n**REDIRECT URLS**:\n\n  - http://localhost:5023/authorized\n  - https://localhost:5023/authorized\n\n**JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS**:\n\n  - http://localhost:5023\n  - https://localhost:5023\n\nRemember that it might take a while for the tokens to start working.\n\n### OMIM API\nYou can [register][omim-register] for free OMIM API access. You will be\nsent the authentication token eventually :)\n\n### Gmail\nThe Sanger email feature requires credentials for a Gmail account.

Institutes contain multiple cases and group users into teams. Cases are a unit that is analysed together, usually the same as a family or a tumor/normal sample - they all share a subset of called variants. Variants are individual genotype calls across a single case.\n\n[insert screenshot here]\n\nA case is an interesting concept worth expanding on. Given the context of diagnosing a Mendelian disorder, a case represents the investigation of typically a single family and the quest to find a single disease causing mutation.\nAs such there are some added features that try to support this process:\n\na case can be assigned to a user to delegate responsibility\nvarious variants can be pinned as worth looking at for the whole team\na feed keeps track of any case related activity in one single place\n\nA lot of time has been spent on the layout for the big list of variants as well as the single variant detail view.

The activity log will store records of who did what for future reference, however.\nMark Causative\nA variant is marked causative when it is confirmed to be disease causing in a case. The variant will show up on the case page as causative variant.

One could imagine that in the future, some or all annotations could be performed by Scout. For now scout will look for some known keys when uploading a VCF and extract information for those. VEP is the tool supported for functional and regional annotations at the moment, SnpEff will be added in the near future. For the other types of annotations Scout will look for certain keys in the INFO field of the vcf and expect the value to be of a specific type. This means that there is not a dependency on any other specific annotation tool besides VEP, just make sure that the key and values are correct according to the specification below.\nRank score\nOne of the hard problem when dealing with whole genome data is the huge amount variants that are generated in every analysis. Scout was developed to be used in rare variant analysis, this means that there is ony a small number of variants that are actually interesting to look at. We do not want to store all variants from each case in a database that should be able to controll thousands of cases. To solve this problem we are working with rank scores, each variant is scored according to a scoring schema then we only upload and sort the variants based on their rank score. In this way the users can start by looking at the variants that looks potentially most dangerous from a bioinformatic perspective. We use the tool genmod to (among other things) score the variant, but as long as there is a RankScore-field in the INFO field of the VCF with a float as value it is handeled by Scout.\nAnnotation keys and tool suggestions\nIn this section all the different annotation keys and suggestions of tools that can be used to annotate them are listed.\nFrequencies\n1000G\nThe frequency from the 1000G population database.\n\nKey: 1000G\nValue: Float\nTools: VEP, SnpEff, genmod, vcfanno\n\n1000G_MAX_AF\nThe maximum allele frequency of all populations in the 1000G population database.\n\nKey: 1000G_MAX_AF\nValue: Float\nTools: custom made, we have modified the 1000G file and use genmod\n\nExAC\nThe frequency from the ExAC population database.\n\nKey: EXACAF\nValue: Float\nTools: VEP, SnpEff, genmod, vcfanno \n\nExAC_MAX_AF\nThe maximum allele frequency of all populations ExAC population database. \n\nKey: EXAC_MAX_AF\nValue: Float\nTools: custom made, we have modified the exac file and use genmod\n\nSeverity\nCADD score\nThe Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion(CADD) score.

We are a fan of using Gunicorn for running Python services. It's easy to setup and configure and handles things like multi-processing and SSL/HTTPS without problems. You can setup the server accordingly:\nSCOUT_CONFIG=\"/full/path/to/flask.conf.py\" \\\ngunicorn \\\n    --workers=4 \\\n    --bind=\"HOST:PORT\" \\\n    --keyfile=\"/path/to/myserver.key\" \\\n    --certfile=\"/path/to/server.crt\" \\\n    scout.server.auto:app\n\n"},"blog/":{"url":"blog/","title":"Blog","keywords":"","body":"The Scout blog\n"},"blog/new-3.0.html":{"url":"blog/new-3.0.html","title":"What's new in 3.0?","keywords":"","body":"What's new in 3.0?\nPosted: 11 April 2017\n\n\nThis updates includes a lot of optimizations to improve performance.

You will notice the case view and variants list show up almost instantly!\nEasy access to coverage report PDF\nYou can now download the coverage report as a PDF directly form the case page with one click!\nRevamped gene panel view\nWhen accessing a gene panel you will now see the information regarding disease causing transcripts, reduced penetrance etc. related to each gene. You can also handle updated to the panels directly from this interface. Just add, remove, edit existing genes and commit your changes to automatically update the panel.\nUpdated variant page\nWe've made some tweaks to the variant page like moving the OMIM inheritance model to the OMIM panel, linked to each phenotype.\nMultiple RefSeq transcripts\nThe HGNC based gene definitions have been updated.

For instance, you will be able to get statistics on the number of samples within a cohort, how many are cases solved and which genes there were causative variants in. Or perhaps you want to know which phenotype terms are associated with a particular cohort.\nFor now, the cohort tags are specific to CMMS, but we urge all user to supply to us their own set of tags to be used within the corresponding Scout instance. This applies to phenotype groups as well as we think this will be very useful in future to describe your cohorts clinically.\nNew feature: pip distribution\nScout is now installable via pip! This means installing the server and CLI is as simple as running:\npip install scout-browser\n\nEverything to setup the server; genes, HPO terms, OMIM information, etc. is included in the distribution.\nBug fixes\n\nCompounds are now sorted on combined score\nThe delivery report opens in a new tab\nA link from the variant page to the gene panel exists\nCases are properly activated when variants are first viewed\nFixed display of HGVS description\nFixed issues with Sanger email\nSupport for a new analysis type: TGA, Targeted Genome Analysis\nFixed issue with filtering on 1000G frequency\n\n"},"blog/new-3.2.html":{"url":"blog/new-3.2.html","title":"What's new in 3.2?","keywords":"","body":"What's new in 3.2?\nPosted: 3 May 2017\nNew feature: Frequency links\nWe have added several frequency resources links to the variant frequency table on the variants page.\n\nBeacon: enabled searches in the global beacon network\n\nNote: this is only outgoing queries and does not expose any variants in Scout.\n\n\nGnomeAD: the new version of EXAC, which includes approximately 120,000 exomes and 15,000 genomes.
