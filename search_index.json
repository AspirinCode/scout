are divided into multiple sections.\nOne section describes how to set up a demo version with some cases just to see how it could look like.\n0. Intro\nMake sure you have a mongod process running. First install mongodb and follow the instructions.\n1. Install\nInstallation of Scout is possible via pip or GitHub.\nLet's start by pulling down the GitHub repository with the source code.\nGitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout\ncd scout\npip install --requirement requirements.txt --editable .\n\nPip\nTo get the latest version, use the above. When using pip the latest stable release will be installed.\npip install scout-browser\n\n \"Credentials\". Here you will\nfind your \"CLIENT ID\" and \"CLIENT SECRET\". You also need to add some\n\"REDIRECT URLS\" and \"JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS\".\n\n**REDIRECT URLS**:\n\n  - http://localhost:5023/authorized\n  - https://localhost:5023/authorized\n\n**JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS**:\n\n  - http://localhost:5023\n  - https://localhost:5023\n\nRemember that it might take a while for the tokens to start working.\n\n### OMIM API\nYou can [register][omim-register] for free OMIM API access. You will be\nsent the authentication token eventually :)\n\n### Gmail\nThe Sanger email feature requires credentials for a Gmail account. Any\naccount should work so you don't need to sign up for any special access.\n\n### MongoDB\nIf you are using a password protected Mongo database you also need to add\nthe authentication details to the instance config.\n\n\n## 3. Boostrap\nWe use gulp.js to compile the statis assets (CSS, JS, etc.)\n\n```bash\n$ gulp build --production\n```\n\n\n## 4. Develop\nYou are now ready to start the development server and complete the setup\nin the admin interface.\n\n```bash\n$ python manage.py -c \"$(pwd)/configs/boilerplate.cfg\" vagrant\n```\n\nThat's it! Go and explore Scout. -->\n2. Setup\nFull setup\nTo initialize a working instance with all genes, diseases etc run\nscout setup database\n\nfor more info, run scout --help\n\nIf you intent to use authentication, make sure you are using a Google email!\n\nThe previous command setup the database with a curated collection of gene definitions with links to OMIM along with HPO phenotype terms. Now we will load some example data. Scout expects the analysis to be accomplished using various gene panels so let's load one and then our first analysis case:\nscout load panel scout/demo/panel_1.txt\nscout load case scout/demo/643594.config.yaml\nFor more information about populating the database, please see admin-guide.\nDemo\nThis option is used to quickly get a operating instance with some example data\nscout setup demo\nscout --demo serve\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nMy email is white listed but I can't log into Scout\nYou can be logged into multiple Google accounts at the same time.

A user can belong to one or many institutes.\nYou access Scout by signing into your Google account. We recommend you enable 2-step verification to your account for an added layer of security!\nA user can be granted a specific \"admin\" role. Such users will be able to access all institutes, case, and gene panels by default.\nSharing cases\nA case has one owner institute, however, individual cases can be shared between multiple\ninstitutes. Any user with access to a case can decide to share it with any other institute.\nCase related functions can be used by both institutes, however, the Sanger email will go to\nthe owner institute.\nAnnotating cases\nScout allows users to add a lot of information around uploaded cases. You can:\n\nadd HPO phenotype groups and more specific terms\nmaintain a free-text synopsis of the case in question\nadd comments about the case and progress of interpretation\npin interesting variants that you want other colleagues to have a look at\nfinally you can mark one or more causative variants when a case is closed\n\n"},"features/hpo.html":{"url":"features/hpo.html","title":"HPO phenotypes","keywords":"","body":"HPO phenotypes\nFor every case you have the opportunity to add related HPO phenotype terms to describe the phenotype of the patient(s). This structured data can then be used in some interesting ways. You access all these features from the case page.\nHPO gene panel\nEvery HPO term is linked to a set of genes. It it interesting to see which genes that overlap with your phenotype terms. To generate such a list, locate the \"HPO panel\" button. You can optionally select which terms to include by using the check boxes next to the HPO terms.\nBy default only genes matching every selected HPO term is returned. This setting can be customized by entering the minimum number of HPO terms a gene is required to overlap.\n\nThe panel is only stored until a user regenerates the panel!\n\nThe generated panel will show up just below under \"HPO gene panel\".\nPhenomizer diseases\nThe second option is to use the same HPO terms as input to the Phenomizer service. This will use you selected phenotypes to look up possible OMIM diseases. You will be presented with all hits on a new page where you can select which diseases to proceed with.\nPhenomizer associates a P-value with each disease which tells you something about the likelihood of each disease match. You can also see which genes are associated with every disease in the last column.\nWhen you've made your selection, click \"Select\" at the bottom of the table. Scout will then store all the associated genes and list them in the \"HPO gene panel\" list on the \"case\" page.\n"},"user-guide/":{"url":"user-guide/","title":"User Guide","keywords":"","body":"Scout user guide\nScout is a web-based visualizer for VCF-files.

It helps to manage multiple patient cases in a unified and intuitive interface. Users can collaborate with other clinicians sharing comments and findings across your team.\nInstitutes, Cases, Variants\nScout has a few levels of abstraction to deal with the data it presents. Institutes contain multiple cases and group users into teams. Cases are a unit that is analysed together, usually the same as a family or a tumor/normal sample - they all share a subset of called variants. Variants are individual genotype calls across a single case.\n\n[insert screenshot here]\n\nA case is an interesting concept worth expanding on. Given the context of diagnosing a Mendelian disorder, a case represents the investigation of typically a single family and the quest to find a single disease causing mutation.\nAs such there are some added features that try to support this process:\n\na case can be assigned to a user to delegate responsibility\nvarious variants can be pinned as worth looking at for the whole team\na feed keeps track of any case related activity in one single place\n\nA lot of time has been spent on the layout for the big list of variants as well as the single variant detail view. They are meant to give a quick overview to enable efficient scanning of the information. It is also in this direction they will evolve in the future.\n"},"user-guide/using-scout.html":{"url":"user-guide/using-scout.html","title":"General Usage","keywords":"","body":"Pinning a variant\nIf you find a variant that seems interesting enough that you believe someone should follow it up, you could consider \"pinning it\" to the case. This means that it will show up for all users to see in the case view along other pinned variants.\nA variant can be pinned by anyone and likewise unpinned by anyone (not just the person who originally pinned it). The activity log will store records of who did what for future reference, however.\nMark Causative\nA variant is marked causative when it is confirmed to be disease causing in a case. The variant will show up on the case page as causative variant. A case can have multiple causative variants.\nWhen a variant is marked causative, Scout will remember the variant so when when entering a new case Scout will indicate if a variant that was previously marked causative within the same institute exists in the particular case.\nSending Sanger email\nIt's possible to send an email to a user defined email address with information regarding a variant for Sanger validation. You can access this functionality through the variant detail view in the upper right ahnd corner.\nLocal Frequency Database\nThis is not really a local frequency database but rather an indication if we have seen a variant before and in what form. It should work as a guide to exclude variants that exists due to artifacts in the sequencing process or if it as been observed in any of the earlier cases.\nVariants are added to the database in the following way:\n\nFor each case we pick one affected individual\nVariants are filtered out based on if they are common or have a very low call quality\nThe remaining variants are stored in loqusdb\n\nEach time the user looks at a variant scout will ask locusdb how many times it has been seen across all cases from all institutes (obs.), how many times it has been seen in a homozygous state (homo.) and how many cases these numbers are based on (tot.).\n"},"user-guide/pages.html":{"url":"user-guide/pages.html","title":"Pages","keywords":"","body":"Pages\nScout can be logically separated into a number of pages with different responsibility and purpose.

You can filter the list by typing into the search box above the list.\nA quick link to get straight to the list of all clinical variants is also displayed. To indicate what cases have recently been added/updated, a \"last updated\" date is also displayed.\nSometimes you will also see a cyan colored dot to the left of the case ID. This is an indicator that there's been some recent activity in the case such as a new comment.\nYour name will be tagged for each case that is assigned to you. For cases that are assigned to other people you will see a tag \"ASSIGNED\".\n\nCase\nThis is the detailed view of one individual case. The intended use is to give a consise overview of the family under investigation and show recent activity related to the case.\nPinned variants\nThere's a list of \"Strong candidates\" on the page. This list is curated by the collaborators and consists of \"pinned\" variants from the variants list. This feature can be used to mark variants of particular interest that you might want to highlight to other users (See more under \"Variant\".)\nMisc.\nThe case page also displays a simple wiki-style synopsis on the current case that can be used to communicate information on the case to collaborators.\nThe \"Activity\" feed is a reverse chronological list of events and comments related to the case. Examples of events include comments, status updates, assignments, Sanger sequencing orders etc.\nActions\nThere are a few actions you can take on this page.\nAdopt case: By clicking the button next to \"Adopt\" you can assign yourself to a case unless someone else has already done so. If you have assigned yourself to a case you can click your name to \"unassign\".\nThe case can be moved to \"Research\" which means all variants will be made visible for the entire exome. Clicking \"Open research\" will notify the administrators of the site. The user agrees that she is reponsible to have acquired an informed consent relevant for this action. This will also be logged as a new event in the case log.\nEdit case synopsis: The case sysnopsis can be edited in a format known as [Markdown][markdown]. Just click \"EDIT\" to open the editor view. When you are finished click \"SAVE\" to save changes or \"CANCEL\" to abort.\nComment: You can leave comments in the activity log by writing a message in the input box next to the feed.

We've made significant efforts to make sure the way we store information in the database will scale up with additional features in the future. Here are the highlights:\nMore responsive interface\nLoading pages in the web interface is now much faster. You will notice the case view and variants list show up almost instantly!\nEasy access to coverage report PDF\nYou can now download the coverage report as a PDF directly form the case page with one click!\nRevamped gene panel view\nWhen accessing a gene panel you will now see the information regarding disease causing transcripts, reduced penetrance etc. related to each gene. You can also handle updated to the panels directly from this interface. Just add, remove, edit existing genes and commit your changes to automatically update the panel.\nUpdated variant page\nWe've made some tweaks to the variant page like moving the OMIM inheritance model to the OMIM panel, linked to each phenotype.\nMultiple RefSeq transcripts\nThe HGNC based gene definitions have been updated. One key difference is that there we can now have multiple RefSeq transcripts per Ensembl transcript ID.\n"},"blog/new-3.1.html":{"url":"blog/new-3.1.html","title":"What's new in 3.1?","keywords":"","body":"What's new in 3.1?\nPosted: 27 April 2017\nThis updates contains many bug fixes and a few new features.\nNew feature: cohort tag\nWe have introduced \"cohort tags\", where you can tag each case as belonging to one or several cohorts.\nFuture release of Scout will include functionality to get statistics on selected cohorts or all cases. For instance, you will be able to get statistics on the number of samples within a cohort, how many are cases solved and which genes there were causative variants in. Or perhaps you want to know which phenotype terms are associated with a particular cohort.\nFor now, the cohort tags are specific to CMMS, but we urge all user to supply to us their own set of tags to be used within the corresponding Scout instance. This applies to phenotype groups as well as we think this will be very useful in future to describe your cohorts clinically.\nNew feature: pip distribution\nScout is now installable via pip! This means installing the server and CLI is as simple as running:\npip install scout-browser\n\nEverything to setup the server; genes, HPO terms, OMIM information, etc. is included in the distribution.\nBug fixes\n\nCompounds are now sorted on combined score\nThe delivery report opens in a new tab\nA link from the variant page to the gene panel exists\nCases are properly activated when variants are first viewed\nFixed display of HGVS description\nFixed issues with Sanger email\nSupport for a new analysis type: TGA, Targeted Genome Analysis\nFixed issue with filtering on 1000G frequency\n\n"},"blog/new-3.2.html":{"url":"blog/new-3.2.html","title":"What's new in 3.2?","keywords":"","body":"What's new in 3.2?\nPosted: 3 May 2017\nNew feature: Frequency links\nWe have added several frequency resources links to the variant frequency table on the variants page.\n\nBeacon: enabled searches in the global beacon network\n\nNote: this is only outgoing queries and does not expose any variants in Scout.\n\n\nGnomeAD: the new version of EXAC, which includes approximately 120,000 exomes and 15,000 genomes.
