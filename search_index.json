are divided into multiple sections.\nOne section describes how to set up a demo version with some cases just to see how it could look like.\n0. Intro\nMake sure you have a mongod process running. First install mongodb and follow the instructions.\n1. Install\nInstallation of Scout is possible via pip or GitHub.\nLet's start by pulling down the GitHub repository with the source code.\nGitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout\ncd scout\npip install --requirement requirements.txt --editable .\n\nPip\nTo get the latest version, use the above. When using pip the latest stable release will be installed.\npip install scout-browser\n\n \"Credentials\". Here you will\nfind your \"CLIENT ID\" and \"CLIENT SECRET\". You also need to add some\n\"REDIRECT URLS\" and \"JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS\".\n\n**REDIRECT URLS**:\n\n  - http://localhost:5023/authorized\n  - https://localhost:5023/authorized\n\n**JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS**:\n\n  - http://localhost:5023\n  - https://localhost:5023\n\nRemember that it might take a while for the tokens to start working.\n\n### OMIM API\nYou can [register][omim-register] for free OMIM API access. You will be\nsent the authentication token eventually :)\n\n### Gmail\nThe Sanger email feature requires credentials for a Gmail account. Any\naccount should work so you don't need to sign up for any special access.\n\n### MongoDB\nIf you are using a password protected Mongo database you also need to add\nthe authentication details to the instance config.\n\n\n## 3. Boostrap\nWe use gulp.js to compile the statis assets (CSS, JS, etc.)\n\n```bash\n$ gulp build --production\n```\n\n\n## 4. Develop\nYou are now ready to start the development server and complete the setup\nin the admin interface.\n\n```bash\n$ python manage.py -c \"$(pwd)/configs/boilerplate.cfg\" vagrant\n```\n\nThat's it! Go and explore Scout. -->\n2. Setup\nFull setup\nTo initialize a working instance with all genes, diseases etc run\nscout setup database\n\nfor more info, run scout --help\n\nIf you intent to use authentication, make sure you are using a Google email!\n\nThe previous command setup the database with a curated collection of gene definitions with links to OMIM along with HPO phenotype terms. Now we will load some example data. Scout expects the analysis to be accomplished using various gene panels so let's load one and then our first analysis case:\nscout load panel scout/demo/panel_1.txt\nscout load case scout/demo/643594.config.yaml\nFor more information about populating the database, please see admin-guide.\nDemo\nThis option is used to quickly get a operating instance with some example data\nscout setup demo\nscout --demo serve\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nMy email is white listed but I can't log into Scout\nYou can be logged into multiple Google accounts at the same time.

A user can belong to one or many institutes.\nYou access Scout by signing into your Google account. We recommend you enable 2-step verification to your account for an added layer of security!\nA user can be granted a specific \"admin\" role. Such users will be able to access all institutes, case, and gene panels by default.\nSharing cases\nA case has one owner institute, however, individual cases can be shared between multiple\ninstitutes. Any user with access to a case can decide to share it with any other institute.\nCase related functions can be used by both institutes, however, the Sanger email will go to\nthe owner institute.\nAnnotating cases\nScout allows users to add a lot of information around uploaded cases. You can:\n\nadd HPO phenotype groups and more specific terms\nmaintain a free-text synopsis of the case in question\nadd comments about the case and progress of interpretation\npin interesting variants that you want other colleagues to have a look at\nfinally you can mark one or more causative variants when a case is closed\n\n"},"features/hpo.html":{"url":"features/hpo.html","title":"HPO phenotypes","keywords":"","body":"HPO phenotypes\nFor every case you have the opportunity to add related HPO phenotype terms to describe the phenotype of the patient(s). This structured data can then be used in some interesting ways. You access all these features from the case page.\nHPO gene panel\nEvery HPO term is linked to a set of genes. It it interesting to see which genes that overlap with your phenotype terms. To generate such a list, locate the \"HPO panel\" button. You can optionally select which terms to include by using the check boxes next to the HPO terms.\nBy default only genes matching every selected HPO term is returned. This setting can be customized by entering the minimum number of HPO terms a gene is required to overlap.\n\nThe panel is only stored until a user regenerates the panel!\n\nThe generated panel will show up just below under \"HPO gene panel\".\nPhenomizer diseases\nThe second option is to use the same HPO terms as input to the Phenomizer service. This will use you selected phenotypes to look up possible OMIM diseases. You will be presented with all hits on a new page where you can select which diseases to proceed with.\nPhenomizer associates a P-value with each disease which tells you something about the likelihood of each disease match. You can also see which genes are associated with every disease in the last column.\nWhen you've made your selection, click \"Select\" at the bottom of the table. Scout will then store all the associated genes and list them in the \"HPO gene panel\" list on the \"case\" page.\n"},"user-guide/":{"url":"user-guide/","title":"User Guide","keywords":"","body":"Scout user guide\nScout is a web-based visualizer for VCF-files.

It helps to manage multiple patient cases in a unified and intuitive interface. Users can collaborate with other clinicians sharing comments and findings across your team.\nInstitutes, Cases, Variants\nScout has a few levels of abstraction to deal with the data it presents. Institutes contain multiple cases and group users into teams. Cases are a unit that is analysed together, usually the same as a family or a tumor/normal sample - they all share a subset of called variants. Variants are individual genotype calls across a single case.\n\n[insert screenshot here]\n\nA case is an interesting concept worth expanding on. Given the context of diagnosing a Mendelian disorder, a case represents the investigation of typically a single family and the quest to find a single disease causing mutation.\nAs such there are some added features that try to support this process:\n\na case can be assigned to a user to delegate responsibility\nvarious variants can be pinned as worth looking at for the whole team\na feed keeps track of any case related activity in one single place\n\nA lot of time has been spent on the layout for the big list of variants as well as the single variant detail view. They are meant to give a quick overview to enable efficient scanning of the information. It is also in this direction they will evolve in the future.\n"},"user-guide/using-scout.html":{"url":"user-guide/using-scout.html","title":"General Usage","keywords":"","body":"Pinning a variant\nIf you find a variant that seems interesting enough that you believe someone should follow it up, you could consider \"pinning it\" to the case. This means that it will show up for all users to see in the case view along other pinned variants.\nA variant can be pinned by anyone and likewise unpinned by anyone (not just the person who originally pinned it). The activity log will store records of who did what for future reference, however.\nMark Causative\nA variant is marked causative when it is confirmed to be disease causing in a case. The variant will show up on the case page as causative variant. A case can have multiple causative variants.\nWhen a variant is marked causative, Scout will remember the variant so when when entering a new case Scout will indicate if a variant that was previously marked causative within the same institute exists in the particular case.\nSending Sanger email\nIt's possible to send an email to a user defined email address with information regarding a variant for Sanger validation. You can access this functionality through the variant detail view in the upper right hand corner.\nLocal Frequency Database\nThis is not really a local frequency database but rather an indication if we have seen a variant before and in what form. It should work as a guide to exclude variants that exists due to artifacts in the sequencing process or if it as been observed in any of the earlier cases.\nVariants are added to the database in the following way:\n\nFor each case we pick one affected individual\nVariants are filtered out based on if they are common or have a very low call quality\nThe remaining variants are stored in loqusdb\n\nEach time the user looks at a variant scout will ask locusdb how many times it has been seen across all cases from all institutes (obs.), how many times it has been seen in a homozygous state (homo.) and how many cases these numbers are based on (tot.).\n"},"user-guide/pages.html":{"url":"user-guide/pages.html","title":"Pages","keywords":"","body":"Pages\nScout can be logically separated into a number of pages with different responsibility and purpose.

To indicate what cases have recently been added/updated, a \"last updated\" date is also displayed.\nSometimes you will also see a cyan colored dot to the left of the case ID. This is an indicator that there's been some recent activity in the case such as a new comment.\nYour name will be tagged for each case that is assigned to you. For cases that are assigned to other people you will see a tag \"ASSIGNED\".\n\nCase\nThis is the detailed view of one individual case. The intended use is to give a concise overview of the family under investigation and show recent activity related to the case.\nCase report page\nIt can be visualized by clicking on the 'Visualize report' link on the left sidebar present on the case view. The case report contains a phenotype info panel as well as an overview of the gene panels used for the analysis. This page is showing also any variant users have been interacting with when working with the case: causative variants, variants pinned as candidates, ACMG or otherwise manually classified variants, as well as variants with any comment field. At the bottom of the report page the 'Dismissed variants' panel lists all variants that have been dismissed, with the reason(s) why they were rejected as candidates. By clicking on the top right button the case report can be exported and saved into a PDF file.\nPinned variants\nThere's a list of \"Strong candidates\" on the page. This list is curated by the collaborators and consists of \"pinned\" variants from the variants list. This feature can be used to mark variants of particular interest that you might want to highlight to other users. Pinned variants for cases with at least one assigned HPO phenotype can be used to produce Clinvar submission files (See more under \"Variant\").\nMisc.\nThe case page also displays a simple wiki-style synopsis on the current case that can be used to communicate information on the case to collaborators.\nThe \"Activity\" feed is a reverse chronological list of events and comments related to the case. Examples of events include comments, status updates, assignments, Sanger sequencing orders etc.\nActions\nThere are a few actions you can take on this page.\nAdopt case: By clicking the button next to \"Adopt\" you can assign yourself to a case unless someone else has already done so. If you have assigned yourself to a case you can click your name to \"unassign\".\nThe case can be moved to \"Research\" which means all variants will be made visible for the entire exome. Clicking \"Open research\" will notify the administrators of the site. The user agrees that she is reponsible to have acquired an informed consent relevant for this action. This will also be logged as a new event in the case log.\nEdit case synopsis: The case sysnopsis can be edited in a format known as [Markdown][markdown]. Just click \"EDIT\" to open the editor view. When you are finished click \"SAVE\" to save changes or \"CANCEL\" to abort.\nComment: You can leave comments in the activity log by writing a message in the input box next to the feed.

One of more pinned variants for a case with assigned phenotype might be used from the Clinvar submission page to create comma separated file to be used in the submission process. The Scout submission form mirrors the fields on the Clinvar submission spreadsheets. Optional case data for one or more pinned variants can also be generated and uploaded together with the variants during the file submission.

The gene panels describes a set of genes with additional information that is often associated with a disease or a disease group.\nA case can then be associated with one or several gene panels.\nFile format\nThe gene panel is a tab separated text file with a header that describes the columns and one line for each gene entry.\nThe columns that will be used by scout is the following:\n\nhgnc_id(int) This identifies the gene. Mandatory\nhgnc_symbol(str) This is used for sanity check when humans look at the file. Optional\ndisease_associated_transcripts(str) ','-separated list of manually curated transcripts. Optional\ngenetic_disease_models(str) ','-separated list of manually curated inheritance patterns that are followed for a gene. Optional\nmosaicism(str) If a gene is known to be associated with mosaicism this is annotated. Optional\nreduced_penetrance(str) If a gene is known to have reduced penetrance this is annotated. Optional\ndatabase_entry_version(str) The database entry version is a way to track when a a gene was added or modified. Optional\n\nEach gene in a gene panel have to be identified with a hgnc id\nFile format 2\nThere is also an option to include all information about a panel in the header of the file. This could make uploading easier, just a matter of taste. In this case include a header with metadata, each of these lines are key-value separated by =. The meta data lines should start with ##\nExample:\n##panel_id=panel1\n##institute=cust000\n##version=1.0\n##date=2016-12-09\n##display_name=Test panel\n#hgnc_id    hgnc_symbol\n7481    MT-TF\n...\n...\n...\n\nNotes on entries\n\nhgnc_id: This one have to be a valid hgnc id that exists in scout\ngenetic_disease_models can be anyone in [AR,AD,XR,XD,MT,X,Y]\nmosaicism Any entry here will be interpreted as true\nreduced_penetrance Any entry here will be interpreted as true\ndatabase_entry_version This should refer to a earlier version of the panel\n\nUploading a new gene panel version\nYou can upload a text file in Scout to update an existing gene panel. It should follow the format specified in this file: panel-example. The file is ; (semi-colon) separated, could also be tab separated.\nYou can also use this example Excel template as a starting point. When you are ready to update the gene panel simply:\n\nchoose \"Save as...\" in Excel and select \"Comma Separated Values (.csv)\" as the format\nfill out the form in Scout and upload the \"*.csv\" file to update your gene panel\n\nUpload from interface\nChoose the menu in top left corner, click Gene Panel. Then under 'new panel' the user can point to a csv file and fill in name and display name.\nUpload with CLI\nWhen uploading from CLI there are more options.

One could imagine that in the future, some or all annotations could be performed by Scout. For now scout will look for some known keys when uploading a VCF and extract information for those. VEP is the tool supported for functional and regional annotations at the moment, SnpEff will be added in the near future. For the other types of annotations Scout will look for certain keys in the INFO field of the vcf and expect the value to be of a specific type. This means that there is not a dependency on any other specific annotation tool besides VEP, just make sure that the key and values are correct according to the specification below.\nRank score\nOne of the hard problem when dealing with whole genome data is the huge amount variants that are generated in every analysis. Scout was developed to be used in rare variant analysis, this means that there is ony a small number of variants that are actually interesting to look at. We do not want to store all variants from each case in a database that should be able to controll thousands of cases. To solve this problem we are working with rank scores, each variant is scored according to a scoring schema then we only upload and sort the variants based on their rank score. In this way the users can start by looking at the variants that looks potentially most dangerous from a bioinformatic perspective. We use the tool genmod to (among other things) score the variant, but as long as there is a RankScore-field in the INFO field of the VCF with a float as value it is handeled by Scout.\nAnnotation keys and tool suggestions\nIn this section all the different annotation keys and suggestions of tools that can be used to annotate them are listed.\nFrequencies\n1000G\nThe frequency from the 1000G population database.\n\nKey: 1000G\nValue: Float\nTools: VEP, SnpEff, genmod, vcfanno\n\n1000G_MAX_AF\nThe maximum allele frequency of all populations in the 1000G population database.\n\nKey: 1000G_MAX_AF\nValue: Float\nTools: custom made, we have modified the 1000G file and use genmod\n\nExAC\nThe frequency from the ExAC population database.\n\nKey: EXACAF\nValue: Float\nTools: VEP, SnpEff, genmod, vcfanno \n\nExAC_MAX_AF\nThe maximum allele frequency of all populations ExAC population database. \n\nKey: EXAC_MAX_AF\nValue: Float\nTools: custom made, we have modified the exac file and use genmod\n\nSeverity\nCADD score\nThe Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion(CADD) score.

Note that chanjo can be used as a standalone but chanjo-report needs to have access to the data produced by chanjo to generate coverage reports. Scout does not require chanjo installed in the path to visualize coverage reports, but it is necessary to install chanjo-report and set up the connection to a database containing coverage data in order to use this fuctionality.\nChanjo database\nChanjo-report (and chanjo) work with MySQL and SQLite databases. This guide explains how to set up a MySQL database since this database is the one used in production at Clinical Genomics. For a guide on how to install MySQL on your server click here. \nOnce the database and the administrator user and password are configured, you can create the new database to contain the chanjo structures. To do so, from a terminal type:\nmysql -u admin_user -padmin_password #no space between -p and password\nmysql> create database chanjo4_demo;\nmysql> exit\n\nTo create a new empty database download the empty schema chanjo4_structure.sql under scout/demo/resources. The command to restore the database from this dump file is:\nmysql -u admin_user -padmin_password chanjo4_demo \nTo create instead a demo database containing coverage data for genes in panel1 for the samples used in the demo version of scout, you might download the schema chanjo4_demo.sql. This file is present in the folder scout/demo, along with the rest of the demo data. The syntax to create the database is the same as above.\nChanjo database consists of 3 tables:\n\nsample:\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nNull\nKey\nDefault\nExtra\n\n\n\n\nid\nvarchar(32)\nNO\nPRI\nNULL\n\n\n\ngroup_id\nvarchar(128)\nYES\nMUL\nNULL\n\n\n\nsource\nvarchar(256)\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\ncreated_at\ndatetime\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\nname\nvarchar(128)\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\ngroup_name\nvarchar(128)\nYES\n\nNULL\n \n\n\n\n\ntranscript:\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nNull\nKey\nDefault\nExtra\n\n\n\n\nid\nvarchar(32)\nNO\nPRI\nNULL\n\n\n\ngene_id\nint(11)\nNO\nMUL\nNULL\n\n\n\ngene_name\nvarchar(32)\nYES\nMUL\nNULL\n\n\n\nchromosome\nvarchar(10)\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\nlength\nint(11)\nYES\n\nNULL\n \n\n\n\n\ntranscript_stat:\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nNull\nKey\nDefault\nExtra          \n\n\n\n\nid\nint(11)\nNO\nPRI\nNULL\nauto_increment\n\n\nmean_coverage\nfloat\nNO\n\nNULL\n\n\n\ncompleteness_10\nfloat\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\ncompleteness_15\nfloat\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\ncompleteness_20\nfloat\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\ncompleteness_50\nfloat\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\ncompleteness_100\nfloat\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\nthreshold\nint(11)\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n_incomplete_exons\ntext\nYES\n\nNULL\n\n\n\nsample_id\nvarchar(32)\nNO\nMUL\nNULL\n\n\n\ntranscript_id\nvarchar(32)\nNO\nMUL\nNULL\n \n\n\n\nchanjo-report\nThis package might be downloaded and installed via git clone and using pip install command (instructions here), but perhaps the easiest way to make sure that it will serve pages once the app is invoked by scout is to install it with this command:\npip install scout-browser[coverage]\n\nJust make sure that both scout and chanjo-report are installed on the same virtual environment (if you are using one).\nNote that chanjo-report requires the package pymysql if it will be connecting to a MySQL database. So if it is not found in the environment you can install it with this command:\npip install pymysql\n\nEnabling the chanjo coverage integration in scout\nIn order to enable the support for the coverage report visualization in scout the configuration file named config.py under scout/server must be modified to include the following line:\n\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@host:port/chanjo4_demo'\n\nThe database URI provided in the line above refers to the MySQL database with the coverage data, so user and password are those used to connect to the database. Default database host and port are localhost and 3306 respectively.\nIf your scout implementation is using another configuration file other than the default config.py then the database connection URI must be added to this file instead.\n\nOnce all the above steps are executed you should see the \"Coverage report\" option on the left side bar under the scout case page. The buttons allow to generate HTML and PDF reports for the case samples.\n"},"admin-guide/indexes.html":{"url":"admin-guide/indexes.html","title":"Indexes","keywords":"","body":"Indexes\nThe indexes that are used is displayed in scout/constants/indexes.md.
