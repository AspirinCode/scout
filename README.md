# Scout [![Build Status][travis-img]][travis-url]
**Analyze VCFs quicker and easier.**

Scout makes you life easier by letting you visualize mutiple VCFs in the browser. You can quickly triage variants in search of those sneeky disease causing mutations. Scout also connects your team by linking user comments to cases and variants. The project is completely open source.

Running server is as simple as:

```bash
$ scout run
Running on http://localhost:5000...
```

## Installation
Scout will ship as a regular Python package through ``pip`` but until then you can install it through GitHub.

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv scout && workon scout
$ pip install git+https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout.git
```

You also need to install MongoDB and run it as a background process.

### Docker
Scout supports Docker deployment. Docker let's you run arbitrary code without having to worry too much about dependencies. If you have Docker and Fig setup, spinning up a Scout instance is as easy as:

```bash
$ fig up
```

This will run the Scout server, MongoDB, and setup proper communication between them. You don't need to worry about anything else.


## Quickstart
Run the following commands to bootstrap your development environment.

```bash
# it's always a good idea to work in a virtual environment
$ mkvirtualenv scout && workon scout
$ git clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout.git
$ cd scout
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

This doesn't mean that everything will work just like that. You also need some Google OAuth keys and other secret stuff. The config should be stored in a config file:

```
/scout
  /instance
    scout-dev.cfg  <-- put config here!
  /scout
```

When you have the instance folder in place you can start Flask like so:

```bash
$ python manage.py -c "$(pwd)/instance/scout.cfg" runserver
Running on http://localhost:5000...
```


## Features
Scout is implemented in Python and uses the Flask web framework. Data is stored in a MongoDB database. Login is handled through Google OAuth. The raw input to Scout is any valid VCF file with one or more samples.


## About
Scout is developed at SciLifeLab [Clinical Genomics](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics) in close collaboration with CMMS at Karolinska Institute.
