## vcf_data_field_type = vcf data line field type e.g integer, float, string.
## vcf_data_field_number = String that describes the number of values that can be included with the field according to vcf spec.
## vcf_data_field_description = informative text about the vcf data line field.
## vcf_data_field_separators = delimiter character within vcf data line field.
## category = vcf data line field key association group e.g. allele_frequency, protein_prediction.
