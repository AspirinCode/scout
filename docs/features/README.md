## User management and security

Scout organizes cases into institutes. A user can belong to one or many institutes.
You access Scout by signing into your Google account. We recommend you enable [2-step verification][2-step] to your account for an added layer of security!

A user can be granted a specific "admin" role. Such users will be able to access all institutes, case, and gene panels by default.

### Sharing cases

A case has one owner institute, however, individual cases can be shared between multiple
institutes. Any user with access to a case can decide to share it with any other institute.
Case related functions can be used by both institutes, however, the Sanger email will go to
the owner institute.

## Annotating cases

Scout allows users to add a lot of information around uploaded cases. You can:

- add HPO phenotype groups and more specific terms
- maintain a free-text synopsis of the case in question
- add comments about the case and progress of interpretation
- pin interesting variants that you want other colleagues to have a look at
- finally you can mark one or more causative variants when a case is closed
