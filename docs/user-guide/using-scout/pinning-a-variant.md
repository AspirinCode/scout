# Pinning a variant
If you find a variant that seems interesting enough that you believe someone should follow it up, you could consider "pinning it" to the case. This means that it will show up for all users to see in the case view along other pinned variants.

A variant can be pinned by anyone and likewise unpinned by anyone (not just the person who originally pinned it). The activity log will store records of who did what for future reference, however.

> In the future, we would also like to add the possibility of linking a confirmed disease causing mutation to a specific case. One could imagine that process to start of by suspecting a variant, pinning it, confirming the mutation, and lastly tagging it as disease causing. This would also allow us to build up a local database of conclusive findings which would be valuable on it's own.
