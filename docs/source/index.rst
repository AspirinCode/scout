   development


Motivation
----------
DNA sequencing is quickly entering the clinical setting. As such we need tools that cater to non-bioinformatics people. Scout is an attempt to provide an interface for bioinformaticians and clinicians alike to collaborate on the interpretation of variant calling results.


Installation
--------------
Scout is not currently on *pip* but we intend on registering it once we work out more specifically the scope of the package.

For now, install as:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout/zipball/master

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* MongoDB


Usage

Roadmap & Wish list
-------------------

- Access rights connected with cases/families. "Admin" users should be able to view any case.

Goals
~~~~~
There are 3 main goals stated for the project.

  1. Visualize (annotated) VCFs
  2. Following (coding) best practices
  3. Be designed as a natural point of entry for customer

For each of these topics there are a number of more concrete objectives ranked as primary, secondary (if possibles), or tertiary (if we have time).

1. Visualize (annotated) VCFs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We don't need to be GEMINI, focus more on visual part, marking, commenting etc.


Contributing

Further details to come at a later stage.
