Choices
---------
**MongoDB**. No migrations. Simple installation.

**Flask**. There isn't any supirior server but we still picked one for a reason. Flask is very Pythonic, a large and growing user base, lots of actively developed extensions, and uses Jinja2 which is the best templating engine around. In short, it meets all the nessesary requirements for a good choice of Python server. What finally convinced me that it was the right choice for this project was reading `these comments <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2705770>`_.

**MongoEngine**. Using an ODM has the benefit of dealing with a cleaner interface to the database which increases code readability. It also allows us to use the Flask-Admin plugin and enforces DRY when using Flask-WTForms.
