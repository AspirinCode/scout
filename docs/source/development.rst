Choices
-------
**MongoDB**. No migrations. Simple installation.

**Flask**. There isn't any supirior server but we still picked one for a reason. Flask is very Pythonic, a large and growing user base, lots of actively developed extensions, and uses Jinja2 which is the best templating engine around. In short, it meets all the nessesary requirements for a good choice of Python server. What finally convinced me that it was the right choice for this project was reading `these comments <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2705770>`_.

**MongoEngine**. Using an ODM has the benefit of dealing with a cleaner interface to the database which increases code readability. It also allows us to use the Flask-Admin plugin and enforces DRY when using Flask-WTForms.


Flask structure
---------------
As much as possible, we try to separate code into logical Blueprints. I've also set up an experiment to futher componentalize blueprints. Now, blueprint-specific extensions are defined inside the blueprint and initialized in a custom ``init_blueprint`` function.

The Blueprint is now responsible for templates, (static files), Flask extensions, and views. One extension is the admin blueprint where I haven't worked out a way of overwriting templates inside the blueprint package.


Fixtures data
-------------
Flask defaults to using fixtures in the form of JSON documents (that are also meant to be used for testing.) The content in ``tests/fixtures/{families,variants}.json`` should reflect how variants and families will be delivered from either of the backend adapters.

The default fixtures adapter is implemented in ``chanjo.ext.backend.FixtureAdapter``. If you are writing a new adapter, please look at the implementation of the FixtureAdapter and BaseAdapter to follow the defined API style.
