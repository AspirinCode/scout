pymongo.py

This is the new mongo adapter for scout that skips mongoengine and uses pymongo, 
it is a communicator for quering and updating the mongodatabase.


This is best practice:

 uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (
        quote_plus(user), quote_plus(password), host)
    client = MongoClient(uri)

This is to check if server is available:

from pymongo.errors import ConnectionFailure
    client = MongoClient()
    try:
        # The ismaster command is cheap and does not require auth.
        client.admin.command('ismaster')
    except ConnectionFailure:
        print("Server not available")
